# Projds_spam
Here I will deploy a machine learning model using Python, HTML, and CSS. I will first train a machine learning model for the task of SMS Spam detection. The task of SMS spam detection model is to classify spam and not spam messages.

The application will show you whether it’s spam or not. Now let’s see how to train and deploy this machine learning model using Python, HTML and CSS.

To Deploy a model using Python, HTML and CSS we need 4 files, namely:

App.py: The driver code, which will consist of the code to train a machine learning model and creating a flask API.
home.html: which will be a landing page where we will deploy our model.
style.css: which will be used to design our landing page
result.html: which will show us the result whether the message is spam or not.
Now let’s train and deploy our model using Python, HTML and CSS. Let’s start by creating the first file that is app.py. You can download the dataset that I am using from below. Before I start writing code make sure that you create all these folders as mentioned below and add the home.html and result.html files in the templates folder. Likewise, you need to add the style.css file in the static folder.
